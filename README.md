WikiSort
======

WikiSort is a sorting algorithm that's stable, has an O(n) best case and quasilinear worst case, and uses O(1) memory. <b>This is a live standard, and <i>will</i> change as superior techniques become known.</b> Feel free to add your own improvements!<br/><br/>

This algorithm is based on the one described in <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225153768_Ratio_Based_Stable_In-Place_Merging">"Ratio based stable in-place merging", by Pok-Son Kim and Arne Kutzner</a>, although it uses a simplified and optimized design.

<b>Features:</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Does not use recursion or dynamic allocations.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Runs faster if the data is already partially sorted.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• Is a stable sort, which means equal items retain their order in relation to each other.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• 2-5x faster than stable_sort() in many common cases (85% as fast with random inputs).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• 5-12x faster than GCC's equivalent __inplace_stable_sort(), in <i>all</i> cases!
